# ☁️✨ PastelSecure Chat ✨☁️

> *Keep your secrets safe in a pixelated pastel wonderland!* 🎀👾

Welcome to **PastelSecure Chat**, the cutest way to send encrypted messages! We've combined military-grade security with a nostalgic 8-bit aesthetic because privacy should look adorable. (｡◕‿◕｡)

## 🌟 Features

*   **🔒 End-to-End Encryption:** We use fancy math (Diffie-Hellman & AES-GCM) so only you and your friend can read the messages.
*   **👾 Retro Pixel Art Style:** Chunky borders, pixel fonts, and 8-bit vibes!
*   **🍬 Pastel Palette:** Soft blues and whites that are gentle on your eyes.
*   **☁️ Local & Private:** No servers store your chats! It works right in your browser.

## 🎮 How to Play (Use)

1.  **Open the App:** You and your bestie need to open the app.
2.  **Exchange Keys:** You'll see a big "Your Public Key" box. Copy that jumble of text! 🗝️
3.  **Share:** Send your key to your friend (via email, text, or carrier pigeon 🐦).
4.  **Connect:** Paste *their* key into the "Peer's Public Key" box and hit **START CHAT**.
5.  **Chat Away:** Once the hearts align (and the keys match), you are in a secure tunnel! 💬✨

## 🛠️ The Magic Behind the Curtain
